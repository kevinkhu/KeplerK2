# KeplerK2

Uniform catalogs of stars and planets from the Kepler and K2 missions. The Kepler planets file differs from the Kepler planet table in Hardegree-Ullman et al. (2025) in that the orbital periods come from the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) table rather than derived quantities based on the semi-major axes reported in Berger et al. (2020). There is negligible difference between the reported and derived orbital periods, but the uncertanties from the KOI table are much lower. 

If you use the data within this prepository please cite: Hardegree-Ullman et al. 2025 (add link/more details when paper is published).
