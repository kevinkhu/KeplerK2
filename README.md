# KeplerK2

Uniform catalogs of main sequence stars and exoplanets from the Kepler and K2 missions. The Kepler planets file differs from the Kepler planet table in Hardegree-Ullman et al. (2025) in that the orbital periods come from the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) table rather than derived quantities based on the semi-major axes reported in Berger et al. (2020). There is negligible difference between the reported and derived orbital periods, but the uncertanties from the KOI table are much lower. Also, these planet tables include all planets and are not just limited to super-Earths and sub-Neptunes.
